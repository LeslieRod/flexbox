    <h1>Filming Locations</h1>
	  <p>It's not often that movies remain popular for as long as John Hughes's 1980's teen classics have-- and it's even more rare to find teen movies that were (and still are) as well received as Hughes's. Part of what makes his movies so awesome is how authentic they are-- which probably has something to do with the fact that he wrote his movies to take place in the suburbs where he grew up, just outside Chicago; he even filmed a majority of them in and around the Windy City, too. So hop in your 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder (if you can pick one up, I highly recommend it. It is so choice) and head for Illinois to check out some of the many filming locations with this John Hughes guide to Chicago!</p><br>

			Ferris Bueller's Day Off: John Hughes described this movie as his "love letter to Chicago", and it definitely shows. The city's landmarks are highlighted as Ferris and friends ditch school one last time to have the ultimate day off that only Chicago can provide. According to the Internet, the specific day was likely June 5th 1985 based on the baseball game Ferris, Cameron and Sloan attended at Wrigley Field, although the Von Steuben Day Parade (where Ferris jumped on the float and did a rousing lip synch to "Twist and Shout") always takes place in September.</p>

			The Breakfast Club: John Hughes intended this to be his first film, so he wrote it to take place in one location and feature relatively unknown actors to keep costs down and convince investors to fund the movie-- little did he know that what started as a small movie would become a classic. It was all filmed at Maine North High School, which closed in 1981 and is now a police communications center/Illinois lottery payment office/government building. Fun fact: since the school's actual library was too small, they built a larger library set in the gymnasium.</p>

			Home Alone: KEVIIIIIIIIIN! Roll up to the Home Alone House, where the wily 8-year-old Kevin McCallister spent a few days all on his own in this Christmas classic-- it's actually a really swanky mansion (no wonder the neighborhood was being targeted by burglars in the film).</p>
